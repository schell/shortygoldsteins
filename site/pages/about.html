      Opening my own restaurant has been my dream since I was a child, learning to cook with my
      grandmother, Adaire, and my mother, Arlene. As a teenager, I took over cooking Sabbath
      dinners; pot roasted brisket, and my mother’s challah. I knew I wanted to one day be a chef, but
      my grandmother wasn’t so sure whether I would stick to that aspiration, or become a business
      man like my father. Every time we would talk, she’d ask, “So, you still want to be a chef?” and I’d
      assure her that she would be the first to know if I ever changed my mind.

      I started my professional career as a dishwasher and worked my way up. Over the years, I have
      been lucky enough to work with, and learn from, some of Tucson and San Francisco’s great chefs.
      I have been going to the San Francisco farmers markets every week, getting to know the amazing
      people growing our food. Throughout my time working in top restaurants, learning technique
      and foods from the Mediterranean to Asia, I kept coming back to the food of my family. I wanted
      to create a Jewish deli where I could share my family’s recipes, utilizing the technique I’ve learned
      and the fresh ingredients available to us in California. It would also give me the opportunity to
      explore even more traditions in Jewish cooking.

      My restaurant is named Shorty Goldstein’s after my great grandmother Pauline. Her maiden
      name was Goldstein, but when my grandfather Osman first met her, her married name was
      Sholder. He joked that, at 4’10”, she barely came up to his shoulder. He asked her permission to
      call her Shorty and the nickname stuck.

      There are many prized recipes in my family, most notably, Shorty’s potato knish. Shorty would
      come to visit Tucson for a month every year. She would pick one day, and make hundreds of
      knish. They would be put in my grandmother’s freezer, and rationed to the family throughout
      the year. We would wait eagerly by the kitchen, to make sure that we each got our share. When
      they came out of the oven, piping hot, my brothers and I would immediately shove one into our
      mouths, incurring burns, but ensuring the opportunity for a second knish. After Shorty was gone,
      my grandmother would only make them on special occasions. I loved them so much, I made sure
      she taught me how to make them.

      I now make those beloved knish, as well as my mother’s challah, my grandmother’s kugel and
      many more recipes, for my guests at Shorty Goldstein’s. It is a privilege to do what I love every
      day and share a piece of my family’s history, while joining the movement to bring back the Jewish
      Deli and help to carry it into the future.
